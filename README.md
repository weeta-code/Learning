## Options Backtesting Simulator

A robust stock options backtesting simulator that fetches historical stock data and shows how different strategies might've worked and where. Currently support for 9EMA and 200EMA but feel free to add your own strategies into it. Also has an in-built options pricer using Black-Scholes to test out what contracts performed well and whether they were Long Calls or Long Puts.
