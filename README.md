## High Volatility Options Screener

A robust stock options screener, that iterates through a provided list of stock symbols and updates recursively every 30 seconds with new information. It includes a bollinger bands calculation and implied volatility calculation to signal to the user when is a good time for a put or for a call. At the moment only supports Naked Long Calls or Long Puts. Future implementation of auto-trading planned. Generally calculated and simplified for lower portfolio use.
